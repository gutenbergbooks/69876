<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OF the making of Cookery Books, we are told,
there is no end, but the comparative worthlessness
of their contents for practical domestic purposes
is no doubt the reason why there is still as great a
demand as ever for a thoroughly reliable and up-to-date
volume.</p>

<p>The little book I now offer to the public, claims to
be the <i>best, cheapest, and most useful</i> Culinary Handbook
yet produced, and I venture to think its contents will
fully justify this assertion.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the recipes are my <i>own compilation</i>,
and all alike have been <i>carefully revised and
repeatedly tested</i>.</p>

<p>Every recipe has been arranged with a view to
<i>practical usefulness</i>, and may be confidently recommended
for <i>ease of preparation</i>, <i>daintiness</i>, and <i>economy</i>.</p>

<p>Those who once use the “<span class="smcap">Ideal Cookery Book</span>,”
will afterwards use no other, not because their years
have been shortened by bad cooking and unwholesome
food, but because they recognise in it all the qualities
it claims to possess, and are able by its aid to <i>realize
in the home the true “Ideal” of the Culinary Art</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The general rule for roasting or boiling joints is to
allow a quarter of an hour for each pound and half an
hour over, unless the meat is preferred underdone.</p>

<h3>1. Forcemeat.</h3>

<p class="indent">
2-oz. ham.<br>
¼-lb. suet<br>
6-oz. bread crumbs.<br>
2 eggs.<br>
Salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Make it into balls or use as stuffing. Bake ½ hour.</p>

<h3>2. Mince Meat.</h3>

<p class="indent">
1¼-lb. raisins.<br>
¾-lb. sultanas.<br>
1-lb. currants.<br>
½-lb. suet.<br>
¼-lb. peel.<br>
1-lb. sugar.<br>
1-lb. apples.<br>
1-gill of Rum.</p>

<p>Chop the suet very fine, stone the raisins and
chop them, chop the sultanas, peel, and apples, and
add the currants. Put in a bowl with the sugar and
rum and mix very thoroughly. Put in jars and
tie down.</p>

<h3>3. Potato Balls.</h3>

<p>Mash the potatoes—season with pepper and salt
and little chopped parsley and bind with yolk of egg.
Form into balls, dip in egg and bread crumbs and fry
in boiling fat or in the oven—serve hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<h3>4. Tasty dish of Cold Cooked
Beef.</h3>

<p>Butter a pie dish and scatter with bread crumbs
and chopped parsley. Arrange layer of slices of
beef with pepper and salt. Next, layer of crumbs, then
beef, placing sippets of bread on the top. Pour gravy

<div class="blockquot">
<h3>A few hints about Cakes.</h3>

<p>Unless otherwise specified the general rule in making
cakes is to cream the butter and sugar together, then
add the eggs, then flour and baking powder (mix the
baking powder with the flour) and then add fruit or
other ingredients and beat well. If fruit is to be
added do not make the cake very soft, or currants, &amp;c.,
will be liable to sink, but they are less likely to do so
if previously rubbed in flour.</p>

<p>Always grease cake tins with lard as the cakes will
be less liable to burn than if the tins are rubbed with
butter.</p>

<p>Do not open the oven door for at least twenty
minutes after cakes are put in, and then do it very
gently as a sudden action will tend to make a cake
sink in the middle.</p>

</div>
<div class="blockquot">

<h3>1. French Almond Rock.</h3>

<p>Put 1-lb. loaf sugar into a pan with 1 teacup of
water. Stir till the sugar is melted, take off the scum,
and when it has boiled for ¼ hour, add 1 tablespoonful
vinegar or lemon juice. Stir in sliced or blanched
almonds to taste. Pour on a buttered tin, and cut in
slices.</p>

<h3>2. Candy Dough.</h3>

<p><i>Fresh</i> icing sugar. Break the white of an egg into
one glass, and put an equal quantity of water into
another. Put this into a basin, and stir it with the
sugar until it is of a dough-like consistency. The
proportion of the white of egg and water is two to
each pound of sugar.</p>

<h3>3. Candy Cherries.</h3>

<p>Cut off a piece of candy dough and make it into a
thin roll about ½ inch wide. Take a sharp knife and
cut into small pieces, and roll them until they are
like marbles. Split some crystalized cherries, and
press a marble between each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<h3>4. Almond Creams.</h3>

water. Boil the syrup till it thickens. Drop it in cold

adheres, remove from the fire at once without shaking
it, and leave it till cool. When cool, turn it into a
bowl and beat briskly to a thick cream with a wooden
spoon. Knead the paste (like bread) till it becomes
soft and smooth. Flavour with coffee essence or

<p>Slice very thinly 12 Seville oranges and 2 lemons,

clear. Let this remain until the following day. To
every pint of boiled fruit allow 1¼-lbs. lump sugar.
Boil, stirring constantly until the syrup jellies and the
chips are quite clear. Try the jelly on a saucer from

dry place. Any other fruit can be done the same way.</p>

<h3>2. Gooseberry Jelly.</h3>

<p class="indent">
½-stone green gooseberries.<br>
2-quarts water.</p>

<p>Boil together to pulp, tie in a coarse cloth and let it
drip all night, then add 1-lb. sugar to each pint of
juice. Boil gently ¾-hour, and pour into pots.</p>

<h3>3. Apple Jelly.</h3>

<p>Rub the apples, and cut them up without paring or
coring them. Put in a pan and fill with water. Boil 1
hour. Put in a bag and strain. Allow ¾-lbs. sugar to 1
pint of juice, and boil 1 hour. Put a little into a
saucer, and if it jellies it is done. Pour into pots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<h3>4. Cough Mixture.</h3>

<p class="indent">
1d. licorice.<br>
1d. anise seed.<br>
1d. peppermint.<br>
1d. common treacle.<br>
1d. laudanum.</p>

<p>Mix with 1½-pints of cold water and bottle.</p>

<h3>5. Pork Pie Pastry.</h3>

<p>To every 1-lb. of flour allow 6-ozs. of lard and 1
dessertspoonful of salt. Rub the lard into the flour, boil
some milk and mix to a stiff paste. Take some cake
tins and take out the bottoms and line with the warm
paste. Three parts fill with minced pork and put a
cover about 1 inch thick on the top. Make a hole in
the centre and decorate. Place in a fairly hot oven
and bake about 2 hours. Brush with yolk of egg just
before they are cooked.</p>

<p>When the pies are cold, pour into the hole in the
top some gelatine, which has been previously dissolved
in boiling water.</p>

<p>If better pastry is required, add more lard, or use
butter instead.</p>

<h3>6. Recipe for Keeping Eggs.</h3>

<p>Take a large stew pot, or deep bowl, and put a layer
of common salt in the bottom. Then insert a few eggs
with the thin end downwards, and in such a way that
they do not touch each other. Then put another layer
of salt on the top, and repeat the process until the pot
is full, having salt as the top layer. Tie down very
tightly, and whenever an egg is taken out take care
to tie down again. Be sure the eggs are fresh, and
have not been much shaken, and they will keep good
for months.</p>

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
